    <h3>Q 01.</h3>
    <p>
      Five numbers are entered from the keyboard into an array. The number to be
      searched is entered through the keyboard by the user. Write a program to
      find if the number to be searched is present in the array and if it is
      present, display the number of times it appears in the array. // for loop
      till 5 // inside loop, prompt to enter number // push the number to array
      // if arr.lenght ===5 // enter number to find inside the array // for loop
      // arr[i] == enteredNum
    </p>
    <h3>Q 02.</h3>
    <p>
      Five numbers are entered from the keyboard into an array. Write a program

    <h3>Q 03.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a program to copy the contents of one array into another in the

    </p>
    <h3>Q 04.</h3>
    <p>Reverse array without using prototypes [4,8,9,2] to [2,9,8,4]</p>
    <h3>Q 05.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following
      array into a string. Sample array : myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White",
      "Black"]; Expected Output : "Red,Green,White,Black"
      "Red,Green,White,Black" "Red+Green+White+Black"
    </p>
    <h3>Q 06.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array. Sample array :
      var arr1 = [ -3, 8, 7, 6, 5, -4, 3, 2, 1 ]; Sample Output :
      -4,-3,1,2,3,5,6,7,8 let maxVal = 0; arr1[i] > maxVal maxVal = arr[i]
    </p>
    <h3>Q 07.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item in an array.
      Sample array : var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
      Sample Output : a ( 5 times )
    </p>
    <h3>Q 08.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a JavaScript program that accepts a string as input and swaps the
      case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the
      output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
    </p>
    <h3>Q 09.</h3>
    <p>

      case sensitivity).
    </p>
    <h3>Q 10.</h3>
    <p>
      We have the following arrays : color = ["Blue ", "Green", "Red", "Orange",
      "Violet", "Indigo", "Yellow "]; o = ["th","st","nd","rd"] Write a
      JavaScript program to display the colors in the following way : "1st
      choice is Blue ." "2nd choice is Green." "3rd choice is Red." Note : Use
      ordinal numbers to tell their position.
    </p>
    <h3>Q 11.</h3>
    <p>
      There are two arrays with individual values. Write a JavaScript program to
      compute the sum of each individual index value in the given array. Sample
      array : array1 = [1,0,2,3,4]; array2 = [3,5,6,7,8,13]; Expected Output :
      [4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13]
    </p>

      array..
    </p>
    <h3>Q 13.</h3>
    <p>

      pass shallow, the array will only be flattened to a single level. Sample
      Data : console.log(flatten([1, [2], [3, [[4]]],[5,6]])); [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      6] console.log(flatten([1, [2], [3, [[4]]],[5,6]], true)); [1, 2, 3,
      [[4]], 5, 6]

    <h3>Q 14.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a JavaScript program to compute the union of two arrays. Sample Data

    </p>
    <h3>Q 15.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a JavaScript function to remove. 'null', '0', '""', 'false',
      'undefined' and 'NaN' values from an array. Sample array : [NaN, 0, 15,
      false, -22, '',undefined, 47, null] Expected result : [15, -22, 47]
    </p>
    <h3>Q 16.</h3>
    <p>
      Write a JavaScript function to remove a specific element from an array.
      Test data : console.log(remove_array_element([2, 5, 9, 6], 5)); [2, 9, 6]
    </p>
    <h3>Q 17.</h3>
